# Application Server

App server -- Web server: hosts applications or software that delivers a business application through a communication protocol

A __web server__ delivers static web content—for example, HTML pages, files, images, video—primarily in response to hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) requests from a web browser.

An __application server__ typically can deliver web content too, but its primary job is to enable interaction between user clients and server-side application code—the code representing what is often called business logic—to generate and deliver dynamic content, such as transaction results, decision support or real-time analytics.
