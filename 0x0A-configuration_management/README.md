# Configuration Management

Configuration management is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, applications, network devices, and other IT components in a desired state

Typical configuration management tools help teams to:
* Classify and manage systems by groups and subgroups. 
* Centrally modify base configurations.
* Roll out new settings to all applicable systems. 
* Automate system identification, patches, and updates.
* Identify outdated, poorly performing, and noncompliant configurations. 
* Prioritize necessary actions. 
* Access and apply prescriptive remediation.

With __Ansible, Chef, Puppet__, enterprises can manage configurations and simplify the DevOps process as a whole
Puppet provides the ability to define which software and configuration a system requires and then maintain a specified state after an initial setup
__Declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL)__ that is similar to __Ruby__ is used to define configuration parameters for a specific environment or infrastructure
