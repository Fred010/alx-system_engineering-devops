# Web infrastructure design

It explains the dependencies and relationships between the different components of web infrastructures.

For this project, the focus is on Changeability (integration and scalability) and Security (including operational management)

Designing web infrastructure involves planning the components that support web applications. Consider factors like scalability, security, and performance. Common elements include web servers, databases, load balancers, and a content delivery network (CDN). Utilize cloud services for flexibility and scalability. Ensure redundancy for high availability, and implement security measures like encryption and firewalls. Regularly monitor and optimize the infrastructure for optimal performance.
